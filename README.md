In the USA, a significant part of the wages of many service workers come from tips, nominally voluntary payments by the customer in additional to the listed price.  For taxis in New York, tourist advice suggests a tip of 15-20%. You have data (in the 'A2_predicting_taxi_tips/datasets' folder) from two months of taxi trips in New York City, including information on time of day, day of the week, trip distance, price, number of passengers, locations of pickup and dropoff.  
Using the data from week 2 of January 2016 (week2.csv), construct a model that predicts the amount of a tip.  Evaluate the mean squared error of this model on the data from week 4 of January 2016 (week4.csv).  Write a report that describes how you constructed the model and how accurate it is.
